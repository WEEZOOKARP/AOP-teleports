## Simple Teleport Script

This is a basic script I chucked together from scratch in about 5 ish minutes not including youtube time :)

not perfect but who cares, it's small and clean so additions and fixes are simple.

### Config
    {
        label = "Mirror Park", -- text that appears inside teleport
        from = vector3(-1035.12, -2740.52, 20.17), -- where the entrance is
        to = vector3(1129.01, -646.23, 56.83), -- where you get teleported
        colour = {r = 10, g = 255, b = 50, a = 150}, -- red , green, blue, alpha 
    },
